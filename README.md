# HP_Big_data_project
In this repository, I apply some of the techniques learned during the Big Data lessons of the First Level Master in Data Science at Tor Vergata University of Rome.
I am very passionate about the Harry Potter saga, so I've decided to use the text from the seven books by J.K. Rowling for this project.
I split my work into the following steps:
1. Initialize the libraries needed for the analysis.
2. Create the Spark Session and connect GitHub with my Colab folder.
3. Download the texts of the seven books.
4. Define a function to divide each book into chapters, to enable a more granular analysis.
5. Perform some interesting counts on the clean text (e.g., the five most used words for each book and a total count of enchantments).
6. Use the TF-IDF algorithm to find the five most important words for each book. In this case, "important" means words that are most specific to that book.
7. Use the LSH alghoritm to find the most similar pairs of chapters.
8. Use the PageRank alghoritm to find the most relevant character of the entire story. In this case, "relevant" means the most central "point of connection."

I really enjoy this work and I hope that some fans of this saga will enjoy it too.
